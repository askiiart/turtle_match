## Memory Game

This is my final project (option 1) for ITSE-1479. 
Instead of using the provided cardback.png image, I used a photo of one of my turtles as the card back.
 
WARNING: The program works great, as long as you wait until the cards flip back over (if it's an incorrect \
match), before clicking on another card.
