## Memory Game

This is my final project (option 1) for ITSE-1479.

- It is a memory game written in Python, using the turtle module, and pygame.mixer for sound and music.
- Instead of using the provided cardback.png image, I used a photo of one of my turtles as the card back. 

One last note: Sorry if this README file looks weird. I can't see what I'm writing, because the preview in PyCharm isn't working.
